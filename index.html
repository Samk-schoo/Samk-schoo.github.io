"<p>I think that the section on duplication is interesting. The main point that the passage makes is that as things change knowledge and data change rapidly which requires programmers to be able to adjust. Because of this, programmers are in constant maintenance mode to make sure all parts function appropriately.</p><p>The way to keep things from getting too confusing is to use the DRY principle EVERY PIECE OF KNOWLEDGE MUST HAVE A SINGLE, UNAMBIGUOUS, AUTHORITATIVE REPRESENTATION WITHIN A SYSTEM. Essentially, don&rsquo;t repeat yourself. The reason you only want to have one instance of information is because you would have to change all repeats or have to deal with a contradiction in the system.</p><p>Using these methods, you want to keep the low level nitty gritty out of your documentation. The more you need to directly explain what is happening the messier the code is. A person should strive for having the documentation be high level broad strokes explanations of the code.</p><p>The main point of the section is that you want to make it as easy as possible to reuse data and to reuse existing code if it applies. This way you prevent having to have duplicates of data which can cause issues.</p>"
