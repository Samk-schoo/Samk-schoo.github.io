"<p>The part that I found to inspire me was the section about software entropy. The parts that interested me was the parts about how a relatively small portion of the project being messy or incorrect cause a psychological effect about the overall state of the project until the perceived becomes a reality.</p><p>The solution to this is to not allow it to stay that way. Either fix it when it is discovered or contain it to show that you are on top of it.</p><p>The other factor is that if the project is in good standing and well developed, the members will take extra care not to mess up sections of it. While when a problem starts it can quickly snowball. Essentially don&rsquo;t be the one to mess up.</p>"
